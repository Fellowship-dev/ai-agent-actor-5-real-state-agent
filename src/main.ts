    // 1. Determine City and State
    "Step 1. The user will ask you for advice regarding a specific city in the US. " +
    "If the user does not provide a state (like CA or NY), try to guess to which state a city belongs to. " +

    "Step 3. Using the selected Zip Codes, search on Zillow for properties that match the user requirements. " +
    "Remember: Don't perform a Zillow Search until you find a good ranking (every search costs money and you want to save). " +
